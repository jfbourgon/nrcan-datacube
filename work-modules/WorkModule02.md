# Module 2
## STAC Data Frames in a Jupyter Notebook
Explore STAC API + Geopandas inside a Jupyter notebook to compute spatial intersection between STAC collections.  
>For the DEM collections, the intersections will be overlaps based on overlapping map sheets.  
>For NAPL the overlaps will be between time periods of the same collection
## DEM collections
### Canadian Digital Elevation Model (CDEM) mosaics 
(https://datacube.services.geo.ca/api/collections/cdem/)
### Canadian Digital Surface Model (CDSM) mosaics
(https://datacube.services.geo.ca/api/collections/cdsm/)

## National Air Photo Library (NAPL) temporal mosaic collection
### Halifax temporal mosaics
(https://datacube.services.geo.ca/api/collections/halifax/)
### Markham temporal mosaics
